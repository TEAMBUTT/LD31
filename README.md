#### A skeleton project for the Love game framework

__Warning: This project is incomplete and not under active development. I last tested it under Love v0.8.0__

[Love2D](https://love2d.org/) is a fun project that makes game development in pure Lua easy! Unfortunately, Lua can be a unnecessarily awkward to develop games in without some convenience libraries. This is a project skeleton for building games with Love that provides handy libraries including: [Middleclass](https://github.com/kikito/middleclass) (a class implementation), [Stateful](https://github.com/kikito/stateful.lua) (a GoF state pattern mixin for Middleclass), and a few more.
